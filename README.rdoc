== Shared Learning Collaborative integration in a Rails App
This is an exmaple of how to use the omniauth-slc gem to authenticate with SLC API,
and then use the HTTParty gem to make request to the API.

To set up a sandbox enviroment for SLC, follow this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEcG4ef2748
